# Final Project

### Story Pitch
  
  For our final project we hope to examine the relationship between female access to mobile phones and the internet for financial transactions and sexual and reproductive health outcomes among adolescent females in developing countries. The objective of this project is to explore the potential positive impact of technology and financial autonomy on sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including the reduction of stigma, the prevention of unsafe abortions, and the provision of up-to-date resources and support online. By examining data between different countries, we can more accurately observe differences in female access to technology and their sexual and reproductive health outcomes. 
  
  Our analysis will involve comparing two datasets that provide information on technology and financial inclusion and sexual and reproductive health outcomes for adolescent females, defined as 15-19, in multiple countries. We will use our knowledge of R and statistical analysis methods to identify any patterns or trends that emerge from these variables in our two datasets.
  
  Our hypothesis is that there will be a positive correlation between access to technology and positive sexual and reproductive health outcomes among adolescent females. We believe that greater access to mobile phones, digital payments and the internet can provide individuals with greater agency and autonomy to seek out and utilize resources and support related to sexual and reproductive health. This can be particularly valuable for individuals who may face stigma or discrimination related to their sexual and reproductive health, and who may not have access to accurate and up-to-date information through traditional channels such as schools.
  
  This angle is important to note as technology is increasingly playing a bigger role in youth education. Updating curriculum in school systems at the speed of the internet is not realistic. With greater access to the internet, people, more specifically adolescence, will be more likely to be able to identify trustworthy educational resources with a stronger internet literacy. Additionally, financial autonomy can empower female adolescents to make decisions related to their health. 
  
  Overall, our project has the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the sexual and reproductive health in adolescents. A potential correlation between the two would highlight the importance of utilizing technology and the mobile payment systems to promote greater autonomy for female adolescents seeking to exercise their sexual and reproductive health rights. With our findings, policymakers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders working to improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes for adolescent females worldwide could make larger advancements in reducing these inequalities.


### Finding Data

[Adding It Up: Investing in Sexual and Reproductive Health 2019 - Methodology Report Supplementary Materials](https://osf.io/nmf8k/?view_only=)
- Observations: 133
- Features: 156
- This dataset is about sexual and reproductive health costs and outcomes of adolescent females (defined as 15-19) across a multitude of countries
- Because this dataset spans such a large area of topics they had published a methodology report about how they collected all their findings. While reading through multiple reports, there are a couple notable strategies to their data collection. They pull from a variety of surveys and other foundations data with the addition of their own estimates. They also pull data from their past reports. Costs are broken up into indirect and direct costs. "Direct costs are estimated using a bottom-up, ingredients approach, meaning that the costs of resources required to provide a given service are added together to produce a total cost..."Indirect costs, referred to as programs and systems costs, are estimated by applying region-specific markup rates to direct costs...Estimates of the types and quantities of resources required to provide contraceptive services, pregnancy-related and newborn health care, and STI care are based on assumptions from the Lives Saved Tool (Spectrum Version 5.73) and the OneHealth Tool, supplemented by scientific literature, World Health Organization (WHO) policies and general recommendations, and expert review. Country-specific personnel salaries come from WHO-CHOICE personnel cost estimates from 2010 and have been inflated to 2019 levels. Contraceptive commodity costs are average prices for 2015–2018 and come from the Reproductive Health Interchange database. Nearly all prices for drugs and supplies are drawn from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNICEF, Management Sciences for Health and IDA Foundation. The programs and systems costs are based on estimates from UNFPA." The demographics and health data sources come from surveys from the,"Demographic and Health Surveys, UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, U.S. Centers for Disease Control Reproductive Health Surveys, The Lancet Stillbirth Epidemiology Investigator Group, and Performance Monitoring for Action Surveys, among others."

- This article focuses more on the impacts of the politics (Biden-Harris/ Trump-Pence administration and other donor governments, multilateral institutions, low- and middle-income country (LMIC) governments, and civil society organizations)
- Talks a lot about the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post pandemic state of reproductive healthcare and the impact of COVID-19

[Lack of Access to Sexual, Reproductive Health Education and Rights Results in Harmful Practices, Impedes Sustainable Development, Speakers Tell Population Commission](https://press.un.org/en/2023/pop1106.doc.htm)
- Explains how education is a key driver of gender equality and access to sexual education gives women and girls the ability to make informed decisions about their own lives.
- Inspires us to question whether access to sexual education is greater for those with internet and technology.

- How social media greatly affects reproductive rights and access to information in the US
- from this, we think that there is a correlation between the rate of ICT access and adolescent’s reproductive health outcomes across the world.
